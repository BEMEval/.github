# ðŸŒ¿ Welcome to **BEMEval**

**Benchmarking Large Language Models for Building Energy Modeling**

BEMEval is an open-source initiative advancing the intersection of **AI** and **Building Energy Modeling (BEM)**.
We develop benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation tools to measure how effectively large language models (LLMs) can **automate BEM tasks** â€” from interpreting design documentation to generating simulation-ready inputs and structured data.
